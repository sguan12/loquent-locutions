                <p id="about">I actually first had the idea for this website back in 2016, after I went to VBI's debate camp. Debate revealed to me that I really needed to work on my enunciation, not only for spreading (speed-reading) but for everyday life as well. Sometimes, we would warm up by repeating tongue twisters really quickly, and I thought--why not make a website that gives you a tongue twister to practice everyday? I was also interested in coding at the time, and it felt like the perfect project to test my skills with.</p>
                <p id="about">However, I lost motivation and only got busier as I progressed through high school, so I never got around to coding it until four years later during covid quarantine. It's just as well that I waited so long, though. I have more coding experience under my belt and a better idea of all the cool things you add to a website. The possibilities are seemingly endless!</p>
                <p id="about">As you can probably tell, I played around with a lot of CSS properties and SVG animations. I also used Javascript for the "twisters" page, where you can randomly generate tongue twisters. It's certainly not perfect (and there are still so many animations I want to try) but I'm pretty pleased with how it turned out, especially since I learned SO MUCH from this project. I went from a vague understanding of CSS and HTML to knowing what SVG is, how to make my own SVG, what bezier curves are, how to integrate SVG's into an HTML page, how to webscrape with Javascript, why you can't read local files on a webpage and how to get around that, how to animate with CSS, how to customize color themes on vscode (which is unrelated but still)...the list goes on!</p>
                <p id="about">The functionality of the website is pretty self-explanatory: start on the home page, click the title or the navigation button to get to the tongue twister page, the website will give you a random tongue twister, and if you want a different one, click the generate button.</p>
                <p id="about">I hope you have as much fun with it as I did when creating it!</p>
                <p id="about">Cheers, Steph</p>
